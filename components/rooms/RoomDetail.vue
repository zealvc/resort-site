            Charming and romantic,' Round' Cottage on the Santarella Estate in the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts. Formerly, the cottage was sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson's summer studio on the Santarella Estate. The two-story cottage has a charming bedroom with 35 foot high conical ceiling with canopied bed upstairs with views through massive, multi-paned "mill windows" to the trees and sky and out to the lily pond. The downstairs sitting room looks out on the babbling brook and lovely gardens.
